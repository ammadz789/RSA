        "RSA is a public-key, assymetric cryptosystem that is very secure for data transmission. RSA uses a mathematically related pair of keys for encryption and decryption: a public key and a private key. A public key is a cryptographic key that can be used by any person to encrypt a message so that it can only be deciphered by the intended recipient with their private key. A private key, also known as a secret key, is shared only with key's initiator. \n",

For security purposes, the integers p and q should be chosen at random, and should be similar in magnitude but differ in length by a few digits to make factoring harder; p and q are kept secret. I have utilized a random number generator with range 50-100 in order to satisfy the conditions of the two integers being chosen at random and being similar in magnitude. Since these integers should be prime numbers, the Miller-Robin primality test is utilized to determine the primality of the chosen integers. Miller-Robin algorithim is perferred for primality testing over various other algorithims since it is a part of the course; although, the algorithim has been modified slightly. The isPrime function returns value of False if n is certainly not prime. A return value of True means n is very likely a prime. If both integers are not prime, new integers are chosen at random untill the condition of primality is satisfied."
